| Description        |
----------------------

This project aims to make at least some functions from newer versions of Adobe
ColdFusion avilable in older versions.  For example, SessionInvalidate() is new
to CF10 but undocumented features make it possible in at least CF8+, possibly
even CF7.

Each set of functions is wrapped within an "if" statement to make sure they
aren't loaded if the version already supports them.

----------------------
| Requirements       |
----------------------

Functions should work in at least ColdFusion 8+.  Where possible I've tried to
avoid using newer syntax or functions

----------------------
| Usage              |
----------------------

Include the file cfbackport.cfm where you'd like the functions to appear.  Keep
in mind that if you are operating within a CFC, you'll need to include them
there to make use of them.

<cfinclude template="cfbackport.cfm" />
